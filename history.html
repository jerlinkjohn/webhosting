			<h3>This is the history of <b>Kakkanattu</b> Family that hails from the greenish land of Thidanadu at Kottayam district in Kerala state of Indian union</h3>
			<p> India, a union of states, is a Sovereign, Secular, and Democratic Republic with a Parliamentary system of Government. The Indian Policy is governed in terms of the Constitution, which was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949 and came into force on 26 November 1950.
				When India became free, Kerala was made up of two princely states, Travancore and Cochin, and Malabar which was under the direct administration of the British. One of the first steps taken by independent India was to amalgamate small states together so as to make them viable administrative units. In pursuance of this policy the Travancore and Cochin states were integrated to form Travancore Cochin State on 1st July, 1949. But Malabar remained as part of the Madras Province. Under the States Re-organization Act of 1956, Travancore-cochin State and Malabar were united to form the State of Kerala on 1st November, 1956.
			</p>
			<p>
			    History states that Kerala's original inhabitants were animists, followed by the Dravidians. Later, the Indo- Aryans with their military superiority drove the Dravidians down east and south wards. The south was eventually dominated by three powerful kingdoms - The Cheras, Cholas, Pallavas and pandyas.
			    The Dravidian-Aryan encounter led to a complex social pattern in Kerala called "Marumakkathayam" or the matrilineal system, which allowed women the right to inherit the family property. The Brahmins or priestly class were called - Nambudiris. The former chieftains displaced by the Aryan influx, were absorbed into the Kshatriya or the princely class.
			</p>		  
		
		    <p>
			    Regular Warfare among local chieftains led to the evolution of a special community of warriors called Nairs. The Nairs were bred to be fighters. Some of them were trained like the Samurai as suicide squads. Known as  'Chavers', these warriors would fight their way through an enemy attack in an orgy of death, that astonished even the portugese.
			    Kerala is 'God's own land' and a land of great natural beauty. From the majestic heights of the Western Ghats the country undulates westward presenting a vista of silent valleys clothed in the richest green and fruitful coconut trees. The name 'Keralam' is derived from 'Kera' and 'Alam' which means land of coconuts. Among the many rivers that glide across the plains to merge their waters with the Arabian Sea, one of them is Meenachil river.
			    Erattupetta is so called as it is the site of the confluence of two rivers. It had been called 'Erapoli' and 'Erapuzha' in the past. Meenachil river was a major navigable rout at that time, which connected the Malanad to the ports at the Vembanattukayal. It was the main center of Trade and Commerce to the east of Kottayam. Traders were a group among the Hindus called 'Vellalachettikal' and they made use of both road and water transportation facilities. It is assumed that the jungle route to Gudalloor through Pala, Bharananganam or Aruvithura brought a lot of 'Vellala Chettiyar' people from Tamil Nadu, for trade. The river that comes from 'Poonjar' flows through the south of the town and this separates 'Aruvithura' from 'Erattupetta'.
			    There is no correct proof for the history to prove when inhabitation took place. From our ancestors and forefathers, comes to a rough conclusion that inhabitation took during BC 200. 
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    It is believed that St.Thomas traveled through the Meenachil river and reached Aruvithura to establish one of his first communities. At the riverbanks of Meenachil River archaeologists have found the evidence of cultural and social matters. Even though this area has tradition from BC, the developments started in 1st century. The first allopathic doctor came to here in 1936. His name was Dr. P.M. Mathai Pulikkeel.
			    The St. George's Church here is one of the oldest churches in Kerala. It is believed that this church was constructed by St. Thomas. He was on his way to Gudallor and he had not enough time to set up a self contained Christian community (Church). This is how the 'Nasrani' Christians started up in Aruvithura. He had baptized few families hails from Brahmin and placed a cross and hence this is considered as the 1/2 church he built out of the 7 1/2 Churches in Kerala.
			    Kochuveettil family was one of them who got baptism from St. Thomas. The land which was belongs to the family was called Kochuveettil purayidam. This is the place south to the cross which is facing the St. George church. There is a small water flow between the land and the place where the cross is.
			    The reconstruction of this church was done in the 16th century A.D. Built of chiseled granite and painted a pale ash; the church has high, stained glass windows. Before Pala church was built in 1002, Aruvithura used to be the parish.
			    Infact Jews migrated to Kerala even earlier, perhaps arriving from Jerusalem as early as 587 BC and most of them settled at 'Kochi'. Even now we can find many of the old Jewish synagogues around 'Kochi'.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    We know that St Thomas has visited here and during his time this church has came into being. He has baptized few families from the 'Brahmin' community and 'Kochuveettil' family was one of them.
			    The place Erattupetta and Aruvithura was under the control of 'Vadakkumkoor' king in 11th Century.  The palace was located behind the bus station now, where we have the market. At that time the kingdom was divided in to 'Kara' (Area) for the easy of ruling. Each Kara was under the leadership of a 'Pramani' (Leader). 'Kochuveedan, Valiaveedan, Padippura and Thadickan' were the four Pramani at that time in Aruvithura. The Kochuveettil 'Karanavar'(Head of family) was the 'Manikaran'( Finance Minister) of the king during 16th Century. During the time of this Karanavar, the Church at Aruvithura was renovated.
			    At that  time a Muslim missionary called 'Kolahala Bava' came to Aruvithura and converted a lot of people from the 'Vellalachetty' community. This is the beginning of Muslims in Erattupetta. He was also on his way to east and when he reached the mountains he fell sick and died there. That place has become to know in his name and is now known as 'Kolahalamedu'.
			    The head count of Muslims increased drastically and they had built a mosque very near to the church. Gradually this became a disturbance at the church and trouble started against Christians. Then the Kochuveettil Manikaran could not tolerate it any more and he led the military to demolish the mosque. He had used the parts of the mosque to renovate the church. After Kochuveettil Karanavar, Thadickan was the Manikaran.  During this period Christians had decided to move to outskirts of Aruvithura looking for fertile land for agriculture.
			    During 14th century, the Place Madhura was under the ruling of Pandya King 'Manava Vikraman'. He had been defeated by the Chola king and fled to places like Gudalloor, Churulimala, Dindigal, Pazhnimala and at last he came to Poonjar. He carried his 'Rajabhandaram' (Royal Money box). He bought the places around Poonjar and established a Kingdom. He paid a cold coin for one 'Anayadi' of land and altogether he bought 240Sq Km. The kindom had a small strength of army only for the protection of royal family and to keep law and order in the kingdom. This kingdom had never been to any battle with any other military except against the Tippu Sultan of Mysore.  During the occupation of Tippu, he was on his way to south with his army. He stopped over at the banks of river 'Bharathappuzha' near to Aluwa. Rajakesavadasan came to know about the arrival of Tippu and he lead his army to 'Bhoothathankettu' dam. There he opened the dam and the water flooded at Bharathappuzha and hence Tippu and his army turned back. During this attack, the Poonjar army joined Raja Kesavadasan. Because Bhoothathankettu was the boundary of Poonjar kingdom.
			    Later on they were called 'Poonjar Rajavamsam'. The palace and the new generations of the kingdom are still in Poonjar. The seniors at this Royal family now are P. Keralavarmaraja and P.K. Keralavarmaraja.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The history of the Kochuveettil family and the kingdom was engraved on copper strips or plates and made as a book. This was called 'Chembola grandham'. These plates were placed at the Kakkanattu 'Tharavadu' (Parent house) at Thidanadu. During the last quarter of 19th century there was a fire at the Kakkanattu Tharavadu and the copper strips were burnt off. This had been read by the Ittiavira Appan, Appan and Ippappan. From these ancestors my Grandfather 'Chacko Varkey' had been heard about the writings on the copper plate. In 1986 he spend time with his brother 'Scaria' and put it all in writing.
			    The history has come to a parallel path. There are two sayings about the arrival of Kochuveettil karanavar at Thidanadu. Out of the four Pramani under the Vadakkumkoor king, two were Christians. Once both of them engaged in a heat exchange about some matter. The argument became row between them. The king came to know about this and called up the Kochuveettil Karanavar and scolded him.  As he got the 'Rajkopam' (Angry of King) he decided to leave the Manikaran position and migrated to Thidanadu. He bought the land Ikaramattom and later the land near to the temple and built the house. Another path leads to this. The temple at Thidanad was under the governance of 'Meljathikkar' (Upper cast people). Any of the belongings of temple which has become 'Asudham' (Unholy) because of 'Keezhjathikkar' was not useful for the temple. There was a belive among the people that if such asudham items were considered 'Sudham' (Holy) if it had been touched by a 'Nasrani' (Syro-Malabar Catholic). So the governing committee of the temple invited the elder son of Kochuveettil Karanavar to come and settle at Thidanadu for doing the 'Sudhikarmam' (Rite of making Holy). They had arranged the land near to the temple and adjacent to 'Ikaramattom'.  Both these stories can be read together as the Karanavar decided to quit the manikaran and the temple committee might have invited him to settle at Thidanadu.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The same way there are two stories about how the family name 'Kakkanadan' came in to. Vadakkumkoor king gave four kara to each Pramani for governance. Each kara was made of eight 'Nadu' (Village). Together these eight nadu called 'Kakkanadu'. As the Kochuveettil Karananavar was the pramani for Kakkanadu, gradually the family came to be known as Kakkanadan. It is also said to be that the name of the land, the Karanavar purchased near to the Ikkaramattom was Kakkanattu and this became the family name.
			    Kochuveettil Karanavar had six sons. The first stayed at the Kakkanattu Tharavadu in Thidanadu. Second moved to Pala and is known as 'Thottumkal'. The third is 'Aramanoor' and the fourth is 'Mannanal'. Fifth son has gone to Kochi state and settled there. The sixth son moved to 'Chelattu'( Chettuthodu ). He had no children and hence he joined to his eldest brother at his old age. Cheladu was comprised of seven 'cherickal' (A lump sum amount of land) like Chettuthodu, Kathamba, Chavara, Kalayatholi, Veluthamala  etc. All those and a 'Cheppukudam Raasi'(The small gold coins of then, in a small can) he brought and added to the property of Kakkanattu Tharavadu. This Raasi had been placed at the basement of the 'Nilavarakkuzhy' (An underfloor storage facility attached with old houses. All the stocks after the harvest would be stored at this place. The floor of this area would be of soil. The roof of this 3 feet high storage place will be wooden platform and above which usually a bedroom.) This is still there according to the calculations and assumptions of some 'Sthanakkar, Asary (carpenter) and Lakshanakkar' (they are people who do the horoscope and identification good locations for house). One of the descendant of the family few generations before told his family about this Rasi. He told them that "as long as that remain at the basement there would not be any shortfall for the family. But if anyone try to remove that, the family may be dissolved by that."
			    At the beginning of the 17th century, the Karanavar at the Kakkanattu family had a son and his name was 'Kocheppu'. He had a son called 'Kurian' and Kurian had one son called 'Chacko'(James).  Chacko had a sister and she had been married to 'Kannakathu' family at Thidanadu.  Nothing more known about her.
			    Chacko married from 'Naduvakkattu' family at Thidanadu. He had a son called Varkey and three sisters. At that time there was no one in Thidanadu who had any kind of education and literacy. So Chacko arranged a Nair 'Asan'( A teacher who teaches at his house or students house. This is not a formal school education. The place where the teacher sits and teaches at his house was called 'Kalari'. It was very common in Kerala even up to 1970s and early 80s and rarely seen now a days. During 1960s and 1970s one year Kalari education was considered equivalent to nursery for children for the admission to 1st standard) from Edamattom (A place about 5 Km from Thidanadu) to give literacy to Varkey and his 3 sisters. The salary for the Asan was 6 'Para' grains per month. Other than Malayalam they had learnt Tamil, Sanskrit and Naanammonam. On a later time, after their study, the neighbours at Thidanad requested to have a class conducted for their children. So Varkey started to conduct the class for the same aged and younger to him.  When he was 14, the brides parents came to the kalari to see the groom and fixed the marriage. 'Mangalathu' family was a branch of 'Vayalil' family hails from Parappillil. His bride was 'Anna' who hails from Mangalathu. Vayalil Manichan was younger brother of Anna's father. Manichan had only one daughter and her son is the Late His Highness Bishop Joseph Vayalil.
			    Later Chacko had two more sons called 'Ouseppu' and 'Ittiyavira'. Then Chacko decided to give the 'Tharavadu' to Varkey and he built a house at Ikkaramattom and moved with other siblings of Varkey. Later he built a house at 'Thenganal' field and gave to Ouseppu. He married from 'Pallattukunnel' family at Ambara near Bharananganam. Ittiyavira married from 'Kunnumpurathu' family at Thambalakkadu near Kanjirappalli. Three sisters of them were married to 'Poovathinal' family at Ambara, 'Pezhumkattil' family at Thidanad and 'Kollamkunnel' family at Poonjar respectively.
				Chacko had dispersed his property to the sons as follows <br/>
			    Varkey: Kakkanattu Purayidam and Thaithakidiyel chery<br/>
			    Ouseppu: Thenganal Purayidam and Thulissery<br/>
			    Ittiyavira: Ikaramattom and Ponthanal Cherickal<br/>
			    Chelattu purayidam (Chettuchodu) sold to 'Kallivayalil' family for Rs.700 during last quarter of 19th century. This decision might have taken because of the fire burn out at the Kakkanattu Tharavadu.
			    As mentioned before Chacko married from Naduvakkattu. The Karanavar at the 'Pulikkeel' family in Aruvithura was 'Unniyappooppan'.  He had relationship with Naduvakkattu family and that made Chacko and Unniyappooppan brother in laws.  One day Unniyappooppan requested chacko to send Varkey to give literacy to his son 'Kunjouseppu'. So Varkey started to give class for him. Pulikkeel Kunjousepu, Puthenveettil Kunjouseppu and Kuruvachan, Vazheparampil Achan (Fr. Vazheparampil) etc were his students. During this time, Varkey and Valiaveettil Achan were 'Kaikkaranmar' of the St.George's Church Aruvithura continuously for 18 years. (Kaikkaran is the minister of the church, where he is in charge of the implementation of parish council decisions).
			    At the beginning of the 20th century, there were four leading catholic families at Thidanadu. Kakkanattu, Kannakam, Thombil and Anandachery were the four. As time passed many other families migrated to Thidanadu and the number of Catholics also increased. This was the reason to go for a church at Thidanadu. 
			    <p>Kakkanattu Varkey, Kannakathu Varkey and Thattaparambil Varkey gathered together to go for a church. They caught a peacock from the land of Vazhayil Mamman and presented to 'Resident Sayippu' (He is the British governor of the particular area). He granted the permission to build the church and they built the church.</p>
			    The two younger brothers of Varkey, Ouseppu and Ittiyavira sold their property at Thidanad and they have gone to other places. (Recently, the famous writer George Kakkanadan claimed that he is the heir from the family of Ittiyavira.) Nothing more known about Oseppu and Ittiyavira.
			    Even until the late years of his life, Varkey continued his Kalari to teach children due to the request of the neighbours and other villagers. Varkey passed away at the very beginning of 20th Century.
			    Varkey had three sons and two daughters. Kurian, Chacko and Varkey were the sons and Anna and Marium were the daughters. He bought two more lands Chankolickal and Kunnumpuram (Uthiyanaani ).
			    Eldest Anna had been married to Thekkumthottathil family in Thambalakkadu near Kanjirappally. Kurian married Annamma from Vellathottathil family at Thidanadu. He had been given the land of Chankolickal. Chacko married Marium from Thottakkara family at Ambara. He had been given the land 'Thaithakidiyel' at Chemmalamattom. He acquired the near by land Panachikkal which is behind Thonikkavayalil land where the Thuruthiyil family is staying. Marium had been married to Vellathottathil family at Thidanadu. Varkey married from Velanathu family at Thidanad and stayed at the Kakkanattu Tharavadu.
			    Even though Kurian and Chacko moved to different land with different name, the family name was always Kakkanattu. It was the norm at that time to give a name for each purayidam (A section of land) to identify. Family name is separate from land name. Even now, the land name is used to identify the people of same family.  
			    <p>Varkey who was staying at the Tharavadu had a son Joseph (Kochu). He married from Pulikkeel at Erattupetta. They had 3 sons and 2 daughters. Joseph (Thankachan), George (Adv.Georgekutty) and Joychan were the sons. They are staying at the Tharavadu which got a history of 800 years. The center room of the house is about 800 years and this is the only room which survived the fire during end of 19th century. The daughters were Molly who were married to Pulpel family at Kanjirappally and Ansamma.</p>
